# Features:

React image gallery app utilizing the Flickr API. With the help of this powerful "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app is built in the style of modern single page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.

No warnings or errors in console about unused/missing assets.
Running npm start successfully launches the app.
App is broken up into components.
Provided CSS is used and the important aspects of the app generally resemble the mockups.
React Router properly implemented.
URLs correctly match routes.
Clicking a nav link navigates user to new route and loads new data.
Uses Flickr API correctly: API Keys and proper Photo source URLs.
Data fetched from a "container" component that passes data down to presentation component via props.
No console errors or warnings regarding unique "key" props.
Key props passed to images.
Submitting search data returns & displays results.

**FOR EXCEEDS**

App includes a 404-like error route that displays when a URL path does not match an existing route.
App displays a loading indicator each time the app fetches new data on at least the search route.
If no matches are found by the search, the app includes a message to tell the user there are no matches.

`npm start` will run the app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
